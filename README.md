#  FileNameFixer

Getting consistent file names for your own file can be a time-consuming task. 
Especially if the files are downloaded from the Internet and contain unnecessary filler words. 
Often dots are used instead of spaces or the upper and lower case are ignored. 
This program will take care of this problem and renaming files will become a breeze. 

## Features
- Remove filler words
- Replace dots with spaces
- Capitalize words
- Rearrange date to begiining of filename
